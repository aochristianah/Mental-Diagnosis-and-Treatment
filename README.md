# Mental-Diagnosis-and-Treatment-Monitoring (Interactive Dashboard using Power BI)
## Project Overview
This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of mental health diagnosis and treatment data using Power BI. The dataset contained detailed records of hundreds of patient including demographic information (age,gender), clinical diagnosis, sympton severity, treatment types, adherence rates and outcomes.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/aochristianah/Mental-Diagnosis-and-Treatment/blob/main/mental_health_diagnosis_treatment_.csv">Dataset</a>

## Data Description
- Patient ID: Unique identifier.
- Age: Age of the patient.
- Gender: Male or Female.
- Diagnosis: Mental health condition (e.g., Anxiety, Depression).
- Symptom Severity (1-10): Severity of symptoms.
- Mood Score (1-10): Mood rating during treatment.
- Sleep Quality (1-10): Patient-reported sleep quality.
- Physical Activity: Hours per week of activity.
- Medication: Medications prescribed (e.g., SSRIs, Antidepressants).
- Therapy Type: Type of therapy (e.g., CBT, DBT).
- Treatment Start Date: Date treatment started.
- Treatment Duration: Duration of treatment in weeks.
- Stress Level (1-10): Patient's stress level.
- Outcome: Treatment outcome (e.g., Improved, Deteriorated).
- Treatment Progress (1-10): Progress made during treatment.
- AI-Detected Emotional State: AI-detected emotional state (e.g., Happy, Anxious).
- Adherence to Treatment (%): Percentage of adherence to treatment plan.

## KPI's Requirement
- Diagnosis Classification: Classify patients based on their mental health condition.
- Outcome Prediction: Predict treatment outcomes based on patient data.
- Adherence Monitoring: Analyze treatment adherence and its effect on outcomes.
- Emotional State Detection: Use AI to track and predict emotional states.
- Treatment Effectiveness: Evaluate the impact of different therapies on progress.
- Age group distribution: distribution of patients across age groups for each diagnosis
- Overall Improvement Rate.
